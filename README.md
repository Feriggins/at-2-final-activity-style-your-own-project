## How to Play

The object is to have a hand with a total value higher than the dealer’s without going over 21. Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth a value of 10. An Ace has the value of 1 or 11. The remaining cards are counted at face value.

Place a bet in the betting areas marked on the table. You and the dealer are dealt two cards each. If your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued 10), that’s Blackjack! If they have any other total, decide whether you wish to ‘ Hit’ or ‘hold’. You can continue to draw cards until you are happy with your hand.
